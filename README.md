Under the guidance of  Mr. Anubhav Chaturvedi

Aim : The aim of this study was to create classification models for the churn dataset and to predict whether a person abandons us by creating models and to obtain maximum accuracy score in the established models

Steps involved are as follows :

1. Data Analysis
2. Data Visualization
3. Data Preprocessing
4. Modelling
5. Model Tuning
6. Confusion Matrix
7. ROC Curve
8. Reporting 

The model created as a result of LightGBM hyperparameter optimization became the model with the maximum accuracy score [91.16%].
